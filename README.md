The-Ray-Tracer-Challenge:
As a means to practice programming and to learn C# along with .NET Core I will be attempting to implement a Ray Tracer described in the following book: https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge

The Program is currently not optimized, for even basic rendering
Optimizations that can be made:
  Remove the Tuple Object that is being used to represent colours with the int primitive and pack it with 8bits per colour channel
  Use different file format so we do not have to convert all colours to a string.
  Many more.
